# About

Cian Rice is an incredibly passionate web-developer and social media / community manager with a profound love for videogames. Having made his first website at the age of 6 (it was about Saban's __Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers__) and his first game at the age of 10 (it was a __Zelda__-like), Cian has been immersing himself in the creation of games and websites for as long as he can remember. Cian channeled his passion for development and videogames into his academics, attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA for a Bachelor's in Interactive Media & Game Development. After graduating, Cian got to channel his passion professionally in a radically different way - by becoming a part of the community team at Harmonix Music Systems and interacting with fans for major IP like __Rock Band__.

When not working on, talking about, or playing games, Cian is likely talking about or, if you see his headphones on, listening to music. He's a big fan of groups like Nine Inch Nails, CHVRCHES, and Paramore.
