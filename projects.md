# Projects

A listing of projects I've worked on.

**Rock Band Rivals**: The expansion to _Rock Band 4_ the sequel to the highest rated game of all time. I helped maintain Harmonix's CMS backend code by resolving bugs, fixing issues for existing pages, and launching new pages for the studio.

**Harmonix Customer Support Portal**: I led the effort to setup and prep Harmonix's current CX portal for public use. This involved getting a responsive layout ready, transitioning all CX content from Parature to Zendesk, and setting up the CX flow.

**Rock Band 4 Event Setlist**: A [light-weight mobile-ready Rock Band 4 setlist](https://www.events.harmonixmusic.com) for events like PAX and E3. I came up with the idea for this page, executed the original concept for PAX East 2016, iterated for E3 2016, and radically decreased wait time to play Rock Band 4 at Harmonix events.

**Amplitude**: The kickstarted "HD reimagining" of the PS2 classic. I was the very first backer for the game and took on correcting lingering customer support issues post-launch.

**Rock Band 4**: The sequel to the highest rated game of all time. I worked as a community manager handling reactive social media, the occasional press release, and blog post.

**Other**: Check out my [itch page](http://www.thecianrice.itch.io) to see many of my other projects - a mix of gamejam, personal, and academic work.
