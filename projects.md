# Projects

A listing of projects I've worked on.

**Battle Decks 17**: As a part of the Worcester Game Pile I promoted, created powerpoints, helped organize, and participated on the PAX East 2017 panel [Battle Decks 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6O_Jqb7EFE). I then took the footage recorded of the panel and edited the footage into a video that I promoted and released on Youtube for the meetup.

**Rock Band Rivals**: The expansion to _Rock Band 4_, the sequel to the highest rated game of all time. I helped maintain Harmonix's CMS backend code by resolving bugs, fixing issues for existing pages, and launching new pages for the studio.

**Harmonix Customer Support Portal**: I led the effort to setup and prep [Harmonix's current CS portal](https://harmonix.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) for public use. This involved getting a responsive layout ready, transitioning all CS content from Parature to Zendesk, and setting up the CS flow.

**Rock Band 4 Event Setlist**: A [light-weight mobile-ready Rock Band 4 setlist](https://events.harmonixmusic.com/) for events like PAX and E3. I came up with the idea for this page, executed the original concept for PAX East 2016, iterated for E3 2016, and radically decreased wait time to play Rock Band 4 at Harmonix events.

**Amplitude**: The kickstarted "HD reimagining" of the PS2 classic. I took on correcting lingering customer support issues post-launch.

**Rock Band 4**: The sequel to the highest rated game of all time. I worked as a community manager handling reactive social media, the occasional press release, and blog post.

**Other**: Check out my [itch page](https://thecianrice.itch.io) to see many of my other projects - a mix of gamejam, personal, and academic work.
